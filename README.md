server
======

An asynchronous IO notification server lib based on react pattern

You can go through tag v0.01 to v0.10 step by step to learn network programming and Linux system programming

If you want to compile it, please turn to tag v0.**, then make (at least linux kernel 2.6.25)

Notice: This project is just for study, do not use it for your actual product and it still remains a lot of bugs
